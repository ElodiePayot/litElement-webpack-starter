This a starterpack base on [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) and webpack.
This is a "ready for styling" starterpack.
The webpack includes file-loader for fonts and images. It also includes lit-scss-loader (https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-scss-loader) in order to externalize styles from the components, to make JS more readable.
